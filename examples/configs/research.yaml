# Research Assistant Configuration
#
# This configuration file sets up a research-capable agent with:
# - OpenAI's GPT-4 model for advanced reasoning and planning
# - Tools enabled for web search and file reading
# - Higher token budget for longer research contexts
# - Memory system optimized for multi-step research workflows
#
# The research assistant can decompose complex queries, use tools
# to gather information, and synthesize comprehensive responses.

# LLM Configuration
llm:
  # Provider: "openai" or "anthropic"
  # Using OpenAI for this example
  provider: openai
  
  # Model: Using GPT-4 for better reasoning and planning capabilities
  # GPT-4 is more expensive but provides superior performance for
  # complex research tasks that require multi-step reasoning
  # Alternative: gpt-3.5-turbo for faster, cheaper research
  model: gpt-4
  
  # API Key: Authentication for the LLM provider
  # Using environment variable for security (set OPENAI_API_KEY)
  api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
  
  # Base URL for the OpenAI API
  base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
  
  # Temperature: Controls randomness in responses (0.0 to 2.0)
  # 0.5 provides focused, consistent reasoning for research tasks
  # Lower than chatbot to prioritize accuracy over creativity
  temperature: 0.5
  
  # Max Tokens: Maximum length of generated responses
  # 1500 tokens ≈ 1125 words, suitable for detailed research summaries
  # Research responses often need more space than simple chat
  max_tokens: 1500

# Memory Configuration
memory:
  # Max Messages: Maximum number of messages to keep in memory
  # 30 messages = 15 conversation turns
  # Higher than chatbot to maintain context across research sessions
  max_messages: 30
  
  # Token Budget: Maximum tokens to include in context window
  # 4000 tokens allows for longer research contexts
  # Important for maintaining context when using multiple tools
  # and synthesizing information from various sources
  token_budget: 4000

# Tools Configuration
# List of tools available to the research assistant
tools:
  # web_search: Simulated web search capability (WebSearchStub)
  # In production, this would integrate with a real search API
  # like Google Custom Search, Bing API, or SerpAPI
  - web_search
  
  # file_reader: Allows reading and analyzing file contents
  # Useful for examining documents, code, configuration files, etc.
  # The agent can read files to gather information for research
  - file_reader

# Guardrails Configuration
# Empty list for research assistant - we want flexibility
# Research tasks benefit from broad tool access
# In production, you might add:
# - file_path: Restrict file access to specific directories
# - rate_limit: Prevent excessive API calls
guardrails: []

# Research Assistant Notes:
#
# This configuration is optimized for research workflows where the agent:
# 1. Receives a research question or task
# 2. Plans a multi-step approach using available tools
# 3. Executes tool calls to gather information
# 4. Synthesizes findings into a comprehensive response
#
# Example research queries:
# - "Search for information about Rust async programming and summarize key concepts"
# - "Read the README.md file and explain what this project does"
# - "Find information about AI agent architectures and compare approaches"
#
# The higher token budget and message limit support longer research sessions
# where the agent may need to reference previous findings and maintain
# context across multiple tool invocations.
