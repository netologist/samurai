# Simple Chatbot Configuration
#
# This configuration file sets up a basic conversational agent with:
# - OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for natural language understanding
# - Moderate temperature for balanced creativity and coherence
# - Limited token output for concise responses
# - Memory system for maintaining conversation context
#
# The chatbot has no tools enabled, focusing purely on conversation.

# LLM Configuration
llm:
  # Provider: "openai" or "anthropic"
  # Using OpenAI for this example with GPT-3.5-turbo
  provider: openai
  
  # Model: The specific model to use
  # gpt-3.5-turbo is fast and cost-effective for simple conversations
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo
  
  # API Key: Authentication for the LLM provider
  # Using environment variable for security (set OPENAI_API_KEY)
  # Never commit API keys directly in config files!
  api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
  
  # Temperature: Controls randomness in responses (0.0 to 2.0)
  # 0.7 provides a good balance between creativity and consistency
  # Lower values (0.1-0.3) = more focused and deterministic
  # Higher values (0.8-1.5) = more creative and varied
  temperature: 0.7
  
  # Max Tokens: Maximum length of generated responses
  # 500 tokens ≈ 375 words, suitable for concise chatbot responses
  # Adjust higher for longer responses, lower for brevity
  max_tokens: 500

# Memory Configuration
memory:
  # Max Messages: Maximum number of messages to keep in memory
  # 20 messages = 10 conversation turns (user + assistant pairs)
  # Older messages are dropped when this limit is exceeded
  max_messages: 20
  
  # Token Budget: Maximum tokens to include in context window
  # 2000 tokens ensures we stay well within model limits
  # Helps prevent context overflow with long conversations
  token_budget: 2000

# Tools Configuration
# Empty list means no tools are available to this agent
# This chatbot focuses on pure conversation without external actions
tools: []

# Guardrails Configuration
# Empty list means no safety guardrails are enforced
# For a simple chatbot, we rely on the LLM's built-in safety features
guardrails: []
